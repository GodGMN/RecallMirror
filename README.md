## RecallMirror Minecraft mod

**DOWNLOADS** *(Minecraft 1.12.2)*

**Version 1.1.1** - [Download](https://github.com/GodGMN/RecallMirror/raw/master/RecallMirror-1.1.1.jar)

Version changes: added lore on the Nether Mirror to display extra info like depth so you can know if you were in a cave or in the surface for example.

## **HOW TO USE THIS MOD**


Right now it only adds four items:


 

 

## **Block of literal shit**

**A purely cosmetic item.**

The texture will be updated in the future so it can be even more disgusting. It doesn't have any property yet so it sounds like stone and can be insta mined with your bare hands.

 

## **Portal Scroll**

**Right now it doesn't have an use.**

In the future, it will be used to create a single use portal to your bed. In your bed, another single use portal to the last portal will appear, letting you go home and then back to the mine or wherever you were when you created the portals.

 

 

## **Recall Mirror**

**An item that will teleport you to your bed.**

Infinite uses. If you don't have a bed it won't work.

 

 

## **Nether Recall Mirror**

**How do I set up version number?**

Aight no one asked but I'm curious about how do others set their version number. For me it's simple: the first number is reserved for big updates. Will probably stay in 1 forever. The second number is the actual update version, whenever I add something new, it will grow by one. The third and last number grows by one everytime I fix something like a bug or I update a description. Goes back to zero with new "second number" updates.

What does this mean to you? Probably nothing, but if you are in version, let's say 1.4.2 and latest is 1.4.4 I have probably fixed some descriptions or bugs. If it's 1.5.0 you're probably missing out a new item or functionality.
