## **HOW TO USE THIS MOD**


It adds four items:

## **Block of literal shit**

**A purely cosmetic item.**

The texture will be updated in the future so it can be even more disgusting. It doesn't have any property yet so it sounds like stone and can be insta mined with your bare hands.

## **Portal Scroll**

**This item teleports you to your bed or world spawn.**

Single use Recall Mirrors, basically.

## **Changelog**

**Version 1.2.0**

* Portal Scrolls now work as a single use Recall Mirror.
* The Nether Recall Mirror has been updated and now works as an improved Recall Mirror that can teleport you back to your original location.
* The crafting needs to be more expensive since the upgrade from Recall Mirror to Nether Recall Mirror is pretty much for free.
* Since the mod is now 100% working without any game-breaking bug, it's out of beta for now. It still has room for improvement.

**Version beta 1.1.1**

* Added lore on the Nether Mirror to display extra info like depth so you can know if you were in a cave or in the surface for example.

**Version beta 1.1.0**

* Added Nether Mirrors. They let you go back to your last Recall Mirror teleport position.

**Version beta 1.0.1**

* Fixed a bug when using the Recall Mirror without a bed.

**Version beta 1.0.0**

* Mod published. Portal Scrolls are not working so they are purely cosmetics for item frames. The block of literal shit doesn't have any property yet but you can craft and place it.

**How do I set up version number?**

No one asked but I'm curious about how do others set their version number. For me it's simple: the first number is reserved for big updates. Will probably stay in 1 forever. The second number is the actual update version, whenever I add something new, it will grow by one. The third and last number grows by one everytime I fix something like a bug or I update a description. Goes back to zero with new "second number" updates.

What does this mean to you? Probably nothing, but if you are in version, let's say 1.4.2 and latest is 1.4.4 I have probably fixed some descriptions or bugs. If it's 1.5.0 you're probably missing out a new item or functionality.
