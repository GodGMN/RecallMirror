**DOWNLOADS** *(Minecraft 1.12.2)*

**Version 1.01** -  [Download](https://github.com/GodGMN/RecallMirror/raw/master/RecallMirror-1.01.jar)
Version changes: fixed a bug when using the Recall Mirror without a bed.

**Version 1.00**
Mod published. Portal Scrolls are not working so they are purely cosmetics for item frames. The block of literal shit doesn't have any property yet but you can craft and place it.


## **HOW TO USE THIS MOD**


Right now it only adds three items:


 

 

## **Block of literal shit**

**A purely cosmetic item.**

The texture will be updated in the future so it can be even more disgusting. It doesn't have any property yet so it sounds like stone and can be insta mined with your bare hands.

 

## **Portal Scroll**

**Right now it doesn't have an use.**

In the future, it will be used to create a single use portal to your bed. In your bed, another single use portal to the last portal will appear, letting you go home and then back to the mine or wherever you were when you created the portals.

 

 

## **Recall Mirror**

**An item that will teleport you to your bed.**

Infinite uses. If you don't have a bed it won't work.
